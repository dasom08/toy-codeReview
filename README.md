## How to submit Toy Problems

1. First, you put your name and batch in student.json.
```json
{
    "th": "Immersive 기수를 입력해 주세요",
    "name": "Put Your name",
    "problemNumber": "Put Problem number ex)01, 02"
}
```
You can find out which problem you play with for each day on the Google Immersive Calendar.
Put formated number by prepending 0 to single-digit numbers

2. Make new branch.
Please make each toy problem branch from master e.g. toy01, toy02.
Each branch must have its own toy problem commits and file changes relative to the master branch.

3. Send git push to the original repo, and create new pull request.
